No offense to employees of course. I just prefer to take my fate into my own hands.\n\nI started in 1989 with a Fantasy Games shop : selling miniature games, tabletop roleplaying games etc. There was no such market in Belgium at that time, and I not only positioned the hobby, but also turned it into a subculture. Surely some successful products helped me do so, but without doubt being innovative and keeping up a strong marketing strategy made The Lonely Mountain become the uncontested market leader, and turned my 3500$ investment into a 2 million dollar company at it's height, when TLM were 6 shops and a distribution company. Using new and existing technologies to optimize product flow and working comfort were key to fast growth, together with strong financial strategy.\n\nBeing warned about the upcoming financial crisis, and given the decline in the market, I stopped the company in 2007 and withdrew to the far east, to recharge my batteries. Early 2014 I set up a shop for my partner selling sports nutrition and health supplements.\n\nIn May of the same year, I had an idea for a new project for myself, and that is when HowAbout was born.
